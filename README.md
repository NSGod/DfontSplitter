DfontSplitter
=============

This is a work-in-progress rewrite of DfontSplitter in Swift 4, for macOS Mojave.

You can use DfontSplitter for OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and later to convert OS Xâ€™s dfont format files, Font Suitcase files and TrueType Collection (TTC) files into TrueType fonts (.ttf) that can be more easily used across platforms. DfontSplitter is free of charge, and open source under the GNU General Public License v3.
